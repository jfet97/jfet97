## Who is jfet97?

I'm Andrea üòÑ, a freelance software developer with strong skills in JavaScript and TypeScript. Additionally, I'm a huge fan of functional programming and I extensively use libraries like [Effect](https://effect.website/) in my daily work.

### I'm a student

At the moment, I'm a master's student in [theoretical CS](https://didattica.di.unipi.it/laurea-magistrale-in-informatica/curricula/curriculum-software-programming-principles-and-technologies/) at the University of Pisa. I'm strongly drawn to the theoretical aspects of Computer Science. Lately, I have been delving into type systems.

### I'm an educator

I also have a strong passion for sharing my knowledge through articles, videos, and training courses. You can find more by browsing through [my website](https://andreasimonecosta.dev/)!
