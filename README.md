It's a me, Andrea!

I'm a freelance software developer who doesn't like being tied to a specific technology or programming language. However, that's how things are, so I would say I have strong skills in JavaScript and TypeScript and I'm primarily working with Vue. Additionally, I'm a huge fan of functional programming and I extensively use libraries like Effect in my daily work.

At the moment, I'm a master's student in theoretical Computer Science at the University of Pisa. I'm strongly drawn to the theoretical aspects of Computer Science. Lately, I have been delving into type systems.

I also have a strong passion for sharing my knowledge through articles, videos, and training courses. You can find more by browsing through my profile!
